# Identification-Of-Songwriters-And-Song-Genre-Using-Machine-Learning-Algorithms
Abstract:
Within the scope of this project, it is aimed to develop software for
determining song author and genre from lyrics using machine learning algorithms. In this context, determining the song writer and genre specific to Turkish lyrics, creating a large database of Turkish lyrics and making them available to all researchers, obtaining a native and national software for the music industry in accordance with the domestic, constitutes its innovative aspects.

Firstly, a large database containing Turkish lyrics will be created, tagged and made available to researchers within the scope of the project. Then, by using this database, songwriter and genre will be determined both with conventional text classification approach and with deep learning approach. The method determined as a result of the comparative performance analysis will be implemented with an appropriate interface design.

The projects prominent effects are presenting the project outputs as academic
publications in appropriate scientific journals or conferences; Turkish lyrics database creation, tagging of songwriters and genres, determination of song writer and genre with deep learning approach, determination of song writer and genre with conventional text classification approach, performance analysis and comparison of created models.
